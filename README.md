Oh My Fan!
=========

Keep your Mac away from heat!

#### What's Oh My Fan! ?
Oh My Fan! is a very useful app. It allows you to adjust your fan speed to make your Intel Mac run cooler.  
Benefit Highlighting:

* Run in background mode with the CPU temperature info diplayed in the menu bar.

* Drag the pointer in dashboard to adjust the fan speed.

* You can control the fan speed from within the menubar easily.

* See the temperature values in either Celsius(℃) or Fahrenheit(℉).

* You can choose whether the Oh My Fan! will start at login, and I recommend do so.

In order to not damage your machine, Oh My Fan! does not let you set a minimum/maximum speed to a value below/above Apple's defaults.
